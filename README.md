Land Registry on Blockchain

(Working name: SmartLand – can change later)

Overview

This project is a simple blockchain-based land registry prototype.
It allows people to register land details on the blockchain and lets anyone verify those records later.

The goal is to reduce land disputes, fake documents, and trust problems by using blockchain as a public and tamper-proof record system.

This is an early-stage MVP (Minimum Viable Product) built for learning, testing, and future growth.

What the First Version Does

Connect wallet (MetaMask)

Register land on blockchain

Store basic land data:

Land ID

Owner wallet

Owner name

Location

Document hash

Time registered

Verify land by ID

No payments, no government system, no mobile app yet — just a working prototype.

Why This Project

In many places, land issues happen because:

Records are lost

Papers are forged

Systems are slow or corrupt

This project tries to show how blockchain can help by:

Making records public

Making data hard to change

Allowing easy verification

Tech Stack

Solidity – smart contracts

Hardhat – testing and deployment

React – frontend

Ethers.js – blockchain connection

MetaMask – wallet

Testnet – for development

Project Structure

/ backend

Smart contracts

Hardhat config

Deploy scripts

/ frontend

React app

Wallet connection

Forms for registering and verifying land

Current Stage

Refactoring from old Web3 project

Removing NFT and coupon logic

Building new SmartLand contract

Creating basic UI

Future Plans

Add payment for land registration

Add land promotion feature

Build mobile app for field agents

Partner with agents, NGOs, and communities

Improve security and verification

How This Can Make Money Later

Small fee to register land

Fee to verify land

Paid promotion for lands and houses

Partnerships with agents and organizations

Status

This is an early MVP.
Built slowly, tested carefully, and improved step by step.

The goal is not perfection — the goal is progress.
