<p align="center">
Redeem exclusive <strong>Monke community rewards</strong> — from merch discounts to event passes, powered by NFTs.  
</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview
**MonkeMint** is a futuristic Web3 dApp designed for the MonkeDAO community.  
It allows users to **mint NFTs as coupons** that represent exclusive benefits such as:  
- 🎽 *Discounts on official Monke merchandise*  
- 🍌 *Access to the private Discord “Banana Club” lounge*  
- 🎟️ *Free VIP event tickets for upcoming Monke meetups*  

Instead of traditional promo codes or centralized coupon systems, MonkeNFT Coupons uses **blockchain-based NFTs** to ensure transparency, authenticity, and community ownership..  

---

## 🧠 Core Idea  

> Traditional coupons can be duplicated, reused, or expire without clear tracking.  
> MonkeMint solves this by turning each coupon into a verifiable NFT on the blockchain.  

Each NFT coupon:  
- is **unique and tamper-proof**  
- can have an **expiry date**  
- is **owned by the user’s wallet**, not a centralized server  

Built with ❤️ by **Victory**, this project showcases how NFTs can move beyond collectibles and become **utility assets** that drive real-world engagement.

🧩 Challenges Faced

1. MetaMask Slow Response:
During testing, MetaMask sometimes lagged or froze due to local network caching.
This was fixed by clearing site data and resetting the account.


2. Frontend Alignment Issues:
UI alignment was lost after style changes; rebuilt with consistent grid and background layers.


3. Background Integration:
Creating the glowing, futuristic background without motion lag required CSS gradient blending and fine-tuning.


4. Push Conflicts on GitHub:
Solved after learning proper use of git pull --rebase and committing staged changes correctly.


5. OBS Screen Recording Setup:
Configuring OBS to record both screen and voice smoothly for the demo took several attempts.
